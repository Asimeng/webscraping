# webscraping

<p>This program scrapes and monitors the forex exchange rates website of my bank (FNB) and sends me an email when the Rand to Euro rate reaches a certain threshold

<b>Motivation:</b>I found myself consistently checking my bank's exchange rate website when I receive my stipend (which is in euros.) Sometimes, I check more than a normal person should while other times, I completely forget to monitor the rates. Having a program to do monitor the rates and prompt me when the rates are good, I thought will save me a lot of time and some inconvenience.

<b>Implementation: </b> The program is written in R. The Rselenium and rvest packages were used for web scraping components and the gmailr package was used to send emails
