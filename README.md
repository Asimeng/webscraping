# webscraping

<p>This program scrapes and monitors the forex exchange rates website of my bank (FNB) and sends me an email when the Rand to Euro rate reaches a predefined threshold I set.

<b>Motivation:</b>I found myself consistently checking my bank's website for exchange rates whenever I receive my stipend (in a different currency.) I sometimes visit the website more than a normal person should and other times I completely forget to monitor the rates. To save me my precious time and a lot of inconvenience, I thought of automating this process as I have the requisite skills. This led to the development of this program.

<br>

<b>Implementation: </b> The program is written in R. The Rselenium and rvest packages were used for web scraping components and the gmailr package was used to send emails
